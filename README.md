# ArchConfig
Scripts, dotfiles, and resources to setup my Arch-based Linux machines.

## Usage
Clone to a new folder _in your home directory_ and start by running the **01a_install_config.sh** script from within that folder. It should tell you what you need to know from there.

# Wayland support
The Wayland install path using Sway has not been updated in sometime and is likely in a unstable or broken state. The last time I tried Wayland my experience was pretty poor so I gave up and switched back to X11. I do plan on making the switch eventually, but probably only when I _have_ to. At that point the Wayland path should be just as stable and this notice wlll go away.
